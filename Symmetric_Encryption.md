# Symmetric Encryptionüîê

This is a simple Python project to **encrypt** and **decrypt** files using symmetric encryption with the `cryptography` library's Fernet module.

## Usage 
1. **Install the cryptography library**
   ```sh
   pip install cryptography
   
2. **Encrypting a file***
   Run the encryption.py script to encrypt your target file:
   ```sh
   python encryption.py
 This will:
 - Generate an encryption key and save it to key.key.
 - Encrypt the specified file and save it as <filename>.encrypted.
  
3. **Decrypting a file**:
   Run the decryption.py script to decrypt an encrypted file:
   ```sh
   python decryption.py
 This will:
 - Read the encryption key from key.key.
 - Decrypt the encrypted file and save the output.

‚ö†Ô∏è **Important**:
Keep the key.key file safe! Without it, you cannot decrypt your files.

### Notes
- Every time you run encryption.py, a new key is generated. If you want to encrypt multiple files with the same key, save and reuse your key.key.
- Always test decryption to make sure your process works before deleting original files.
